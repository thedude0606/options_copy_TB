## Notes
- The error was an UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'conn' where it is not associated with a value
- This occurred because conn was defined inside the try block but referenced in the finally block
- If an exception occurred before conn was assigned, it would cause this error
- Fixed by initializing conn = None before the try block
- Added os.makedirs() to ensure the directory exists before creating the database file
