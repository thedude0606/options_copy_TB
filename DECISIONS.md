- **Benefits**: Consistent timeframe handling, proper display of different time intervals, improved user experience
- **Implementation**: Created a comprehensive mapping dictionary with proper frequency type and value pairs

### Fallback Mechanism for Data Retrieval
- **Decision**: Implemented multiple fallback mechanisms for retrieving critical data like underlying price
- **Rationale**: Different API responses may contain data in different formats or locations
- **Benefits**: More robust data retrieval, fewer missing data errors, improved reliability
- **Implementation**: Added cascading checks for data in various locations with clear logging of data source

### Type Checking and Exception Handling
- **Decision**: Added extensive type checking and exception handling throughout the data processing pipeline

- **Benefits**: Consistent parameter naming, proper technical indicator calculation, elimination of runtime errors
- **Implementation**: Updated the parameter name in indicators_tab.py to match the expected parameter in technical_indicators.py

### Recommendation Fallback Strategy
- **Decision**: Enhanced recommendation engine to always show top recommendations even when confidence threshold isn't met
- **Rationale**: Users need recommendations even when market conditions don't produce high-confidence signals
- **Benefits**: Ensures recommendations are always available, improves user experience, provides options in all market conditions
- **Implementation**: Added fallback logic to select top 3 recommendations by confidence score when no recommendations meet the threshold

### Recommendation Engine Logic Flow Correction
- **Decision**: Fixed logic flow in recommendation engine to properly implement the fallback mechanism
- **Rationale**: Initial implementation had incorrect conditional nesting that prevented the fallback mechanism from working
- **Benefits**: Ensures recommendations are always displayed, improves reliability of the recommendation system
- **Implementation**: Properly nested conditional statements to ensure filtered recommendations are correctly processed and returned

### Trade Card Component Data Format Compatibility
- **Decision**: Updated trade card component to handle both old and new recommendation data formats
- **Rationale**: The UI component expected a different data structure than what the recommendation engine was providing
- **Benefits**: Ensures recommendations appear in the UI, improves user experience, maintains backward compatibility
- **Implementation**: Modified the trade card component to detect and handle both data formats, with proper fallbacks for missing data

### Symbol Validation and Correction for Historical Data
- **Decision**: Implemented symbol validation and correction for historical data to handle common ticker symbol mistakes

- **Benefits**: Improves user experience, reduces errors, ensures historical data is displayed even with common symbol typos
- **Implementation**: Added a dictionary of common symbol corrections and logic to automatically correct known symbol mistakes

### Technical Indicators Module Enhancement
- **Decision**: Added missing calculate_sma and calculate_ema methods to technical indicators module
- **Rationale**: The indicators chart was failing to display due to missing static methods that were being called in the indicators tab
- **Benefits**: Fixes indicators chart display, ensures all technical indicators are properly calculated and displayed
- **Implementation**: Added static calculate_sma and calculate_ema methods following the same pattern as other static methods in the class

### Historical Data Processing Enhancement
- **Decision**: Enhanced historical data processing with robust error handling and type checking
- **Rationale**: Historical data was not being displayed because the code assumed data would always be in DataFrame format, but it could be None or other formats
- **Benefits**: Ensures historical data is properly displayed regardless of the format returned by the API, provides detailed logging for troubleshooting
- **Implementation**: Added comprehensive type checking, conversion of list data to DataFrame, and detailed error handling with informative logging

## UI Redesign Decisions (March 2025)

### Global Symbol Input
- **Decision**: Implemented a single global symbol input in the application header
- **Rationale**: Previous design had redundant symbol inputs across different tabs, causing confusion and inconsistency

- **Implementation**: Created styled progress bars that reflect confidence percentages with appropriate coloring

### Sidebar Layout for Controls
- **Decision**: Moved filtering and timeframe controls to a dedicated sidebar
- **Rationale**: Previous design scattered controls across different tabs, making them difficult to find and use
- **Benefits**: Improved discoverability of controls, consistent placement of related functionality, cleaner main content area
- **Implementation**: Created a structured sidebar with sections for trading timeframe, market overview, and watchlist

### Responsive Grid Layout
- **Decision**: Implemented a responsive grid layout for recommendation tiles
- **Rationale**: Fixed-width layouts don't adapt well to different screen sizes and device types

- **Benefits**: More accurate profit projections, better exit timing recommendations, improved risk management
- **Implementation**: Implemented a daily theta calculation that adjusts for the non-linear nature of time decay

### Monte Carlo Simulation for Profit Probability
- **Decision**: Used Monte Carlo simulations with 10,000 price paths to calculate profit probabilities

- **Benefits**: Transparent confidence calculation, ability to adjust weights based on performance, detailed signal breakdown
- **Implementation**: Implemented separate scoring functions for technical, profit potential, market condition, and option-specific factors

### Confidence Level Classification
- **Decision**: Mapped numerical confidence scores to semantic confidence levels (very_high, high, moderate, low, very_low)
- **Rationale**: Users need clear qualitative assessments in addition to numerical scores
- **Benefits**: Easier interpretation of recommendations, consistent terminology, better user experience
- **Implementation**: Created threshold-based mapping from numerical scores to semantic confidence levels
