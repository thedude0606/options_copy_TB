# Architectural Decisions

This document records key architectural choices, technology selections, design patterns used, and rationales for important decisions in the options trading platform.

## Key Architectural Choices

### 1. Modular Architecture
**Decision**: Implement a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.
**Rationale**: Modular design allows for easier maintenance, testing, and extension of the codebase. Each module can be developed and tested independently, reducing complexity and improving code quality.

### 2. Multi-Timeframe Analysis
**Decision**: Implement multi-timeframe analysis with confluence detection.
**Rationale**: Trading decisions based on multiple timeframes are more robust than those based on a single timeframe. Confluence detection helps identify stronger signals when multiple timeframes align.

### 3. Risk Management Integration
**Decision**: Integrate risk management directly into the recommendation engine.
**Rationale**: Proper risk management is essential for successful trading. By integrating it directly into the recommendation engine, we ensure that all recommendations include appropriate risk parameters.

### 4. Machine Learning Enhancement Layer
**Decision**: Implement ML as an enhancement layer on top of traditional technical analysis.
**Rationale**: This approach combines the interpretability of traditional technical analysis with the predictive power of machine learning, providing more robust recommendations while maintaining explainability.

## Technology Selections

### 1. Python Ecosystem
**Decision**: Use Python as the primary programming language with libraries like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.
**Rationale**: Python offers a rich ecosystem for data analysis, machine learning, and web development, making it ideal for this application.

### 2. Dash Framework
**Decision**: Use Dash for the web dashboard.
**Rationale**: Dash allows for the creation of interactive web applications with Python, eliminating the need for separate frontend development in JavaScript.

### 3. Schwab API Integration
**Decision**: Integrate with Schwab API for market data and trading.
**Rationale**: Schwab API provides reliable market data and trading capabilities, essential for the application's functionality.

## Design Patterns Used

### 1. Factory Pattern
**Decision**: Use factory pattern for creating different types of indicators and analysis components.
**Rationale**: This pattern allows for flexible creation of different components without tightly coupling the code to specific implementations.

### 2. Strategy Pattern
**Decision**: Implement strategy pattern for different trading strategies.
**Rationale**: The strategy pattern allows for encapsulating different trading algorithms and making them interchangeable, facilitating the addition of new strategies without modifying existing code.

### 3. Observer Pattern
**Decision**: Use observer pattern for real-time data updates.
**Rationale**: This pattern allows components to subscribe to data updates, ensuring that all parts of the application have access to the latest market data.

### 4. Pipeline Pattern
**Decision**: Implement pipeline pattern for feature engineering and data processing.
**Rationale**: The pipeline pattern provides a clean way to chain multiple data processing steps together, improving code organization and reusability.

## Important Implementation Decisions

### 1. Ensemble Approach for ML Models
**Decision**: Use ensemble of multiple ML models rather than a single model.
**Rationale**: Ensemble models typically provide more robust predictions by combining the strengths of different models and reducing overfitting.

### 2. Dynamic Weighting System
**Decision**: Implement dynamic weighting for different factors in the scoring algorithm.
**Rationale**: Market conditions change over time, and a dynamic weighting system allows the algorithm to adapt to these changes, improving performance.

### 3. Confidence Score Calibration
**Decision**: Implement confidence score calibration for recommendations.
**Rationale**: Raw confidence scores may not accurately reflect the true probability of success. Calibration helps align confidence scores with actual outcomes, improving decision-making.

### 4. Phased Implementation Approach
**Decision**: Implement features in phases according to the roadmap.
**Rationale**: A phased approach allows for incremental testing and validation, reducing risk and ensuring that each component works correctly before moving on to the next phase.

### 5. Relative Imports for Module Organization
**Decision**: Use relative imports (with dot notation) instead of absolute imports for internal modules.
**Rationale**: Relative imports make the code more maintainable and less prone to errors when the package structure changes, ensuring proper module resolution within the package hierarchy.

### 6. Disable Synthetic Data Generation
**Decision**: Completely disable synthetic data generation functionality.
**Rationale**: Using real market data provides more accurate and reliable results for trading decisions, eliminating potential biases or unrealistic patterns that might be present in synthetic data.

### 7. Theoretical Options Data from Underlying Assets
**Decision**: Implement theoretical options data generation based on underlying asset prices using the Black-Scholes model.
**Rationale**: When historical options data is unavailable (especially for future-dated contracts), using the underlying asset's price history with option pricing models provides more realistic data than synthetic generation, while still enabling ML models to make predictions for options without historical data.

### 8. Black-Scholes Model Implementation
**Decision**: Use the Black-Scholes model for theoretical option pricing and Greeks calculation.
**Rationale**: Black-Scholes is a well-established and widely accepted model for option pricing that provides a good balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for generating theoretical data points based on underlying asset movements.

### 9. Prioritize Theoretical Approach Using Schwab API Data
**Decision**: Directly use Schwab API data for underlying assets to generate theoretical options data instead of first trying to get historical options data.
**Rationale**: Since options are inherently future-dated instruments, it's more efficient and logical to prioritize the theoretical approach using underlying asset data from the Schwab API rather than searching for historical options data that is unlikely to exist for future contracts.

### 10. Cache Theoretical Data for Performance
**Decision**: Implement caching of generated theoretical data in the database for future use.
**Rationale**: Generating theoretical options data is computationally intensive. Caching this data improves performance by avoiding redundant calculations for the same options contracts, while still maintaining the accuracy benefits of the theoretical approach.
