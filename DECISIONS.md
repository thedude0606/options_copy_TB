# Architectural Decisions

This document records key architectural choices, technology selections, design patterns used, and rationales for important decisions in the options trading platform.

## Key Architectural Choices

### 1. Modular Architecture
**Decision**: Implement a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.
**Rationale**: Modular design allows for easier maintenance, testing, and extension of the codebase. Each module can be developed and tested independently, reducing complexity and improving code quality.

### 2. Multi-Timeframe Analysis
**Decision**: Implement multi-timeframe analysis with confluence detection.
**Rationale**: Trading decisions based on multiple timeframes are more robust than those based on a single timeframe. Confluence detection helps identify stronger signals when multiple timeframes align.

### 3. Risk Management Integration
**Decision**: Integrate risk management directly into the recommendation engine.
**Rationale**: Proper risk management is essential for successful trading. By integrating it directly into the recommendation engine, we ensure that all recommendations include appropriate risk parameters.

### 4. Machine Learning Enhancement Layer
**Decision**: Implement ML as an enhancement layer on top of traditional technical analysis.
**Rationale**: This approach combines the interpretability of traditional technical analysis with the predictive power of machine learning, providing more robust recommendations while maintaining explainability.

### 5. Underlying Symbol Extraction
**Decision**: Extract and use underlying symbols from option symbols for data retrieval.
**Rationale**: Historical data for specific option contracts is often unavailable, but data for the underlying stock is readily accessible. By extracting the underlying symbol, we can retrieve reliable historical data and generate more accurate predictions.

### 6. Comprehensive Error Handling and Logging
**Decision**: Implement a robust error handling and logging system with fallback mechanisms.
**Rationale**: Financial applications require high reliability. A comprehensive error handling system with fallbacks ensures the platform continues to function even when encountering data issues or API failures.

## Technology Selections

### 1. Python Ecosystem
**Decision**: Use Python as the primary programming language with libraries like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.
**Rationale**: Python offers a rich ecosystem for data analysis, machine learning, and web development, making it ideal for this application.

### 2. Dash Framework
**Decision**: Use Dash for the web dashboard.
**Rationale**: Dash allows for the creation of interactive web applications with Python, eliminating the need for separate frontend development in JavaScript.

### 3. Schwab API Integration
**Decision**: Integrate with Schwab API for market data and trading.
**Rationale**: Schwab API provides reliable market data and trading capabilities, essential for the application's functionality.

### 4. SQLite Database
**Decision**: Use SQLite for local data storage.
**Rationale**: SQLite provides a lightweight, file-based database solution that is easy to set up and maintain, while still offering robust SQL capabilities for data storage and retrieval.

### 5. Schwab API Client Methods for Historical Data
**Decision**: Use Schwab API client methods (get_price_history_every_day, get_price_history_every_minute, etc.) for historical price data retrieval.
**Rationale**: The Schwab API provides dedicated methods for retrieving historical price data at various frequencies. By using these native methods, we maintain a consistent data source and avoid dependencies on third-party APIs, ensuring better reliability and data consistency.

### 6. Mock Authentication for Testing
**Decision**: Implement mock authentication and client for testing Schwab API integration.
**Rationale**: Interactive authentication with Schwab API is not feasible in automated testing environments. By implementing a mock client that mimics the behavior of the real Schwab API client, we can test the application's functionality without requiring actual authentication, while maintaining the code structure for when proper authentication is available in production.

## Design Patterns Used

### 1. Factory Pattern
**Decision**: Use factory pattern for creating different types of indicators and analysis components.
**Rationale**: This pattern allows for flexible creation of different components without tightly coupling the code to specific implementations.

### 2. Strategy Pattern
**Decision**: Implement strategy pattern for different trading strategies.
**Rationale**: The strategy pattern allows for encapsulating different trading algorithms and making them interchangeable, facilitating the addition of new strategies without modifying existing code.

### 3. Observer Pattern
**Decision**: Use observer pattern for real-time data updates.
**Rationale**: This pattern allows components to subscribe to data updates, ensuring that all parts of the application have access to the latest market data.

### 4. Pipeline Pattern
**Decision**: Implement pipeline pattern for feature engineering and data processing.
**Rationale**: The pipeline pattern provides a clean way to chain multiple data processing steps together, improving code organization and reusability.

### 5. Adapter Pattern
**Decision**: Use adapter pattern for the options symbol parser.
**Rationale**: The adapter pattern allows the system to work with different option symbol formats by converting them to a standardized format, improving flexibility and compatibility.

### 6. Adapter Pattern for Data Sources
**Decision**: Implement adapter pattern for different data sources (Schwab API, mock client for testing).
**Rationale**: The adapter pattern allows the system to seamlessly switch between different data sources while maintaining a consistent interface, improving flexibility and resilience to API changes or limitations.

### 7. Mock Object Pattern
**Decision**: Use mock object pattern for testing Schwab API integration.
**Rationale**: The mock object pattern allows us to simulate the behavior of complex objects like the Schwab API client, enabling testing without actual API dependencies while ensuring the code structure remains compatible with the real implementation.

## Important Implementation Decisions

### 1. Ensemble Approach for ML Models
**Decision**: Use ensemble of multiple ML models rather than a single model.
**Rationale**: Ensemble models typically provide more robust predictions by combining the strengths of different models and reducing overfitting.

### 2. Dynamic Weighting System
**Decision**: Implement dynamic weighting for different factors in the scoring algorithm.
**Rationale**: Market conditions change over time, and a dynamic weighting system allows the algorithm to adapt to these changes, improving performance.

### 3. Confidence Score Calibration
**Decision**: Implement confidence score calibration for recommendations.
**Rationale**: Raw confidence scores may not accurately reflect the true probability of success. Calibration helps align confidence scores with actual outcomes, improving decision-making.

### 4. Phased Implementation Approach
**Decision**: Implement features in phases according to the roadmap.
**Rationale**: A phased approach allows for incremental testing and validation, reducing risk and ensuring that each component works correctly before moving on to the next phase.

### 5. Relative Imports for Module Organization
**Decision**: Use relative imports (with dot notation) instead of absolute imports for internal modules.
**Rationale**: Relative imports make the code more maintainable and less prone to errors when the package structure changes, ensuring proper module resolution within the package hierarchy.

### 6. Disable Synthetic Data Generation
**Decision**: Completely disable synthetic data generation functionality.
**Rationale**: Using real market data provides more accurate and reliable results for trading decisions, eliminating potential biases or unrealistic patterns that might be present in synthetic data.

### 7. Theoretical Options Data from Underlying Assets
**Decision**: Implement theoretical options data generation based on underlying asset prices using the Black-Scholes model.
**Rationale**: When historical options data is unavailable (especially for future-dated contracts), using the underlying asset's price history with option pricing models provides more realistic data than synthetic generation, while still enabling ML models to make predictions for options without historical data.

### 8. Black-Scholes Model Implementation
**Decision**: Use the Black-Scholes model for theoretical option pricing and Greeks calculation.
**Rationale**: Black-Scholes is a well-established and widely accepted model for option pricing that provides a good balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for generating theoretical data points based on underlying asset movements.

### 9. Prioritize Theoretical Approach Using Schwab API Data
**Decision**: Directly use Schwab API data for underlying assets to generate theoretical options data instead of first trying to get historical options data.
**Rationale**: Since options are inherently future-dated instruments, it's more efficient and logical to prioritize the theoretical approach using underlying asset data from the Schwab API rather than searching for historical options data that is unlikely to exist for future contracts.

### 10. Cache Theoretical Data for Performance
**Decision**: Implement caching of generated theoretical data in the database for future use.
**Rationale**: Generating theoretical options data is computationally intensive. Caching this data improves performance by avoiding redundant calculations for the same options contracts, while still maintaining the accuracy benefits of the theoretical approach.

### 11. VIX Symbol Format Fallback
**Decision**: Implement fallback to "^VIX" format when regular "VIX" symbol fails to retrieve data.
**Rationale**: Many financial data providers, including Schwab API, use the caret (^) prefix for index symbols like VIX. By implementing a fallback mechanism that tries "^VIX" when "VIX" fails, we ensure reliable data retrieval for the VIX volatility index, which is crucial for market analysis and risk assessment.

### 12. Robust Handling of None Values in Risk Management
**Decision**: Implement explicit checks for None values and non-numeric types in risk management calculations.
**Rationale**: Financial data can sometimes contain missing or invalid values. By adding explicit validation for None values and non-numeric types with appropriate default values and warning messages, we prevent runtime errors in mathematical operations and ensure the risk management system continues to function even with incomplete data.

### 13. Multi-Timeframe Data Analysis
**Decision**: Implement a dedicated MultiTimeframeAnalyzer class for analyzing data across multiple timeframes.
**Rationale**: Different timeframes provide different perspectives on market behavior. By analyzing data across multiple timeframes and generating consolidated indicators, we can identify stronger signals and reduce false positives, leading to more reliable trading recommendations.

### 14. Fallback Prediction Mechanisms
**Decision**: Implement fallback prediction mechanisms when options data is unavailable.
**Rationale**: When options-specific data is missing, the system can still generate useful predictions based on underlying asset data and technical indicators. This ensures the platform continues to provide value even with limited data availability.

### 15. Enhanced Logging with Error Tracking
**Decision**: Implement a comprehensive logging system with error tracking and reporting capabilities.
**Rationale**: Financial applications require high reliability and auditability. The enhanced logging system provides detailed information about system operations, errors, and performance, facilitating debugging, monitoring, and compliance requirements.

### 16. DataFrame-Based Technical Indicators
**Decision**: Modify recommendation_engine.py to properly handle DataFrame return values from technical indicator calculations.
**Rationale**: Using DataFrames for technical indicators provides a more structured and consistent approach to data handling. By properly accessing the DataFrame columns instead of trying to unpack return values directly, we ensure compatibility with the technical_indicators implementation and prevent "too many values to unpack" errors, while also gaining access to additional metrics like Bollinger bandwidth that can provide valuable insights for trading decisions.

### 17. Database Connection Initialization
**Decision**: Initialize database connection variables before try blocks and ensure data directories exist.
**Rationale**: Proper initialization of database connection variables before try blocks prevents UnboundLocalError exceptions when errors occur during connection attempts. Additionally, ensuring that data directories exist before attempting to create or access database files prevents file-related errors, improving the robustness of database operations.

### 18. Comprehensive Technical Indicators Implementation
**Decision**: Implement a complete set of technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Stochastic, ATR, ADX, OBV, CMF, MFI, CCI) with standardized interfaces.
**Rationale**: A comprehensive set of technical indicators provides a more complete picture of market conditions and enables more sophisticated trading strategies. By implementing all these indicators with consistent interfaces and proper error handling, we ensure that the recommendation engine has access to a rich set of data points for analysis, improving the quality and reliability of trading recommendations. The standardized approach with both instance methods and static calculation methods allows for flexible usage in different contexts while maintaining code consistency.
