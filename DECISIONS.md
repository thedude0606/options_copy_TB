# Options Recommendation Platform - Design Decisions

## Architectural Choices

### Modular Architecture
- **Decision**: Implemented a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Rationale**: Enables independent development, testing, and maintenance of components
- **Benefits**: Easier to extend with new features, better code organization, simplified debugging

### Data Flow Pattern
- **Decision**: Adopted a unidirectional data flow pattern
- **Rationale**: Provides predictable state management and clear data transformation steps
- **Benefits**: Reduces bugs related to state management, easier to reason about application behavior

### Component-Based UI
- **Decision**: Built UI using a component-based approach with Dash and Bootstrap
- **Rationale**: Promotes reusability and consistent styling across the application
- **Benefits**: Faster development, consistent user experience, easier maintenance

## Technology Selections

### Dash Framework
- **Decision**: Used Dash for building the interactive web application
- **Rationale**: Dash provides Python-based web components that integrate well with data analysis libraries
- **Benefits**: No need for separate frontend/backend technologies, seamless integration with pandas/numpy

### Plotly for Visualization
- **Decision**: Selected Plotly for all data visualizations
- **Rationale**: Offers interactive charts with consistent API that works well with Dash
- **Benefits**: Rich visualization capabilities, consistent user experience, good performance

### Pandas for Data Processing
- **Decision**: Used pandas for all data manipulation and analysis
- **Rationale**: Industry standard for data analysis in Python with comprehensive functionality
- **Benefits**: Efficient data operations, wide community support, well-documented

### Schwab API for Market Data
- **Decision**: Utilized Schwab API for real-time and historical market data
- **Rationale**: Provides direct access to market data without third-party dependencies
- **Benefits**: Reliable data source, comprehensive options data including Greeks

## Design Patterns

### Factory Pattern
- **Decision**: Implemented factory pattern for creating technical indicators and analysis components
- **Rationale**: Centralizes creation logic and provides a consistent interface
- **Benefits**: Easier to add new indicators or analysis methods, improves code organization

### Strategy Pattern
- **Decision**: Used strategy pattern for recommendation engine scoring algorithms
- **Rationale**: Allows for different scoring strategies based on market conditions or user preferences
- **Benefits**: Flexible and extensible recommendation system, easier to test different strategies

### Observer Pattern
- **Decision**: Implemented observer pattern for real-time data updates
- **Rationale**: Enables components to react to data changes without tight coupling
- **Benefits**: Responsive UI that updates automatically when new data arrives

### Repository Pattern
- **Decision**: Used repository pattern for data access layer
- **Rationale**: Abstracts data source details from business logic
- **Benefits**: Easier to switch data sources or implement caching, simplified testing

## Technical Decisions

### Data Processing Pipeline
- **Decision**: Created a multi-stage data processing pipeline
- **Rationale**: Breaks complex calculations into manageable steps
- **Benefits**: Better performance, easier to debug, more maintainable code

### Caching Strategy
- **Decision**: Implemented strategic caching for expensive calculations
- **Rationale**: Reduces redundant calculations and improves responsiveness
- **Benefits**: Better performance, reduced API calls, improved user experience

### Error Handling Approach
- **Decision**: Adopted comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation
- **Rationale**: Ensures application remains functional even when components fail
- **Benefits**: Improved reliability, better user experience, easier troubleshooting

### Datetime Handling Strategy
- **Decision**: Implemented a robust type-checking approach for handling timedelta objects
- **Rationale**: Prevents errors when accessing .dt attributes on non-datetime columns
- **Benefits**: Improved reliability, consistent behavior across different data types, prevention of runtime errors

### Underlying Price Handling
- **Decision**: Modified the options data retrieval process to extract and include the underlying price
- **Rationale**: The underlying price is essential for accurate options analysis and Greeks calculations
- **Benefits**: Enables proper calculation of risk metrics, improves recommendation accuracy, prevents data-related errors

### UI Component Registration
- **Decision**: Implemented a systematic callback registration approach for all dashboard tabs
- **Rationale**: Ensures all UI components are properly connected to their data processing functions
- **Benefits**: Consistent user experience across all tabs, proper functionality of all dashboard features, modular code organization

### Dash Callback Configuration
- **Decision**: Added prevent_initial_call=True parameter to all callbacks using allow_duplicate=True
- **Rationale**: Dash requires prevent_initial_call when using allow_duplicate to ensure predictable callback execution order
- **Benefits**: Prevents DuplicateCallback errors, ensures consistent behavior across page loads, improves application stability
- **Implementation**: Applied to callbacks in historical_tab.py and greeks_tab.py to resolve conflicts with callbacks in run_dashboard.py

### Technical Indicators Implementation
- **Decision**: Modified TechnicalIndicators class to support instance-based usage with data parameter
- **Rationale**: Enables more flexible usage patterns while maintaining static method functionality
- **Benefits**: Resolves initialization errors, improves code organization, and supports both instance and static method calls
- **Implementation**: Added __init__ constructor and instance methods that utilize the class's data attribute

### Variable Naming Consistency
- **Decision**: Standardized variable naming in historical_tab.py for frequency parameters
- **Rationale**: Ensures consistent variable references between definition and usage points
- **Benefits**: Prevents "name not defined" errors and improves code readability
- **Implementation**: Aligned variable names between period mapping definition and API call parameters

### Visualization Techniques
- **Decision**: Used specialized visualization techniques for different data types
- **Rationale**: Different data requires different visualization approaches for clarity
- **Benefits**: More intuitive data presentation, better insights for users
