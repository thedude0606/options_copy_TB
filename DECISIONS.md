- **Benefits**: Enables proper calculation of risk metrics, improves recommendation accuracy, prevents data-related errors
- **Implementation**: Enhanced get_option_chain_with_underlying_price method to check for 'underlyingPrice' (camelCase), 'underlying_price' (snake_case), and the 'underlying' object for price information

### UI Component Registration
- **Decision**: Implemented a systematic callback registration approach for all dashboard tabs
- **Rationale**: Ensures all UI components are properly connected to their data processing functions
- **Benefits**: Consistent user experience across all tabs, proper functionality of all dashboard features, modular code organization

### Dash Callback Configuration
- **Decision**: Added prevent_initial_call=True parameter to all callbacks using allow_duplicate=True
- **Rationale**: Dash requires prevent_initial_call when using allow_duplicate to ensure predictable callback execution order
- **Benefits**: Prevents DuplicateCallback errors, ensures consistent behavior across page loads, improves application stability
- **Implementation**: Applied to callbacks in historical_tab.py and greeks_tab.py to resolve conflicts with callbacks in run_dashboard.py

### Technical Indicators Implementation
- **Decision**: Modified TechnicalIndicators class to support instance-based usage with data parameter
- **Rationale**: Enables more flexible usage patterns while maintaining static method functionality
- **Benefits**: Resolves initialization errors, improves code organization, and supports both instance and static method calls

- **Implementation**: Added validation for period types, frequency types, and frequency values with automatic correction of invalid values

### API Response Processing Improvement
- **Decision**: Enhanced API response processing in run_dashboard.py, options_data.py, and data_collector.py
- **Rationale**: Different response formats from Schwab API require flexible handling to extract data correctly
- **Benefits**: Properly displays market data and additional features, prevents zeros showing for every symbol
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added type checking, multiple data extraction paths, and comprehensive error handling
  - Enhanced data_collector.py to handle multiple response structures, particularly adding support for when data is in a 'quotes' array
  - Added better debugging output to show the full response structure for troubleshooting
  - Implemented cascading checks for price data in various locations within the response
  - Added specific handling for price data nested under the 'extended' object within symbol data based on user feedback and log analysis
  - Implemented calculation for netChange and netPercentChangeInDouble values using lastPrice from extended data and previousClose from fundamental data when not directly available in the API response
  - Added robust previousClose extraction with multiple fallback mechanisms to find previousClose values in various locations of the API response (fundamental object, regularMarketPreviousClose, underlying object) with reasonable defaults for common symbols

### Feature Tab Integration in Simplified Dashboard
- **Decision**: Implemented proper callback registration and content generation for additional feature tabs
- **Rationale**: The simplified dashboard's additional features (Options Chain, Greeks, Technical Indicators, Historical Data, Real-Time Data) were showing only placeholder text instead of actual data
- **Benefits**: Ensures all additional features display proper data when a symbol is searched, provides a complete user experience
- **Implementation**:
  - Modified integration.py to properly register callback functions for each tab (register_greeks_callbacks, register_historical_callbacks, register_real_time_callbacks, register_indicators_callbacks)
  - Updated the update_feature_content callback to return actual component content instead of placeholder text
  - Added symbol validation to ensure features only attempt to display data when a valid symbol is provided
  - Implemented proper error handling to provide meaningful feedback when data cannot be retrieved
