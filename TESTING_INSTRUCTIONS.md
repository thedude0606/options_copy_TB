# Testing Instructions for Simplified Options Dashboard

## Overview

This document provides step-by-step instructions for testing the new simplified options recommendation platform. The implementation focuses on short-term options trading (15, 30, 60, and 120-minute timeframes) with a clean, Robinhood-inspired UI and clear validation visualizations.

## Getting Started

### 1. Pull the Latest Changes

```bash
# Navigate to your local repository
cd /path/to/options_copy_TB

# Fetch the latest changes
git fetch origin

# Switch to the product-enhancement branch
git checkout product-enhancement

# Pull the latest changes
git pull origin product-enhancement
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have all the required dependencies:

```bash
# Install required Python packages
pip install dash dash-bootstrap-components plotly pandas numpy
```

## Running the Simplified Dashboard

### 1. Launch the New Dashboard

```bash
# Navigate to your repository
cd /path/to/options_copy_TB

# Run the simplified dashboard
python run_simplified_dashboard.py
```

The dashboard should start and be accessible at: http://localhost:8050

### 2. Testing the Dashboard

Follow these steps to test the core functionality:

1. **Enter a stock symbol** (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL) in the search box and click "Search"
2. **Select a timeframe** from the dropdown (15m, 30m, 60m, 120m)
3. **View recommendations** that appear as cards with clear call/put indicators
4. **Filter recommendations** using the Call/Put/All buttons
5. **View validation charts** that show why each recommendation was made
6. **Adjust settings** by clicking the settings icon to modify confidence thresholds and indicator weights

## Key Features to Test

### Short-Term Recommendations

- Verify that recommendations are generated for the selected timeframe
- Check that the confidence score and risk/reward ratio are displayed
- Confirm that the expiration dates are appropriate for short-term trading

### Validation Visualizations

- Examine the price chart with technical indicators
- Verify that support/resistance levels are displayed
- Check that the target price is clearly marked
- Review the risk/reward visualization

### Timeframe Filtering

- Test switching between different timeframes (15m, 30m, 60m, 120m)
- Verify that recommendations update appropriately for each timeframe

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check the console output** for error messages
2. **Verify your Schwab API credentials** are properly configured
3. **Ensure all dependencies** are correctly installed
4. **Restart the application** if it becomes unresponsive

## Providing Feedback

After testing, please provide feedback on:

1. UI simplicity and effectiveness
2. Quality and accuracy of recommendations
3. Usefulness of validation visualizations
4. Any bugs or issues encountered

## Next Steps

Based on your feedback, we'll refine the implementation and prepare for the final release. Future enhancements may include:

1. Sentiment analysis integration
2. Advanced filtering options
3. Performance optimizations
4. Mobile-responsive design improvements
