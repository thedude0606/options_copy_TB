# Options Recommendation Platform Product Development Plan

## Executive Summary

After reviewing your GitHub repository, documentation, and UI screenshots, I've developed a comprehensive product development plan to transform your options recommendation platform into a streamlined, Robinhood-like experience focused on short-term options trading (15-120 minutes). This plan addresses your key requirements:

1. Simplifying the UI while maintaining powerful functionality
2. Focusing on short-term options trading recommendations
3. Implementing robust data validation
4. Creating visualizations that validate recommendations

The current platform has strong technical foundations but needs significant UI improvements and a refocused recommendation engine to support short-term trading decisions.

## 1. Current State Assessment

### Strengths
- Comprehensive data collection from Schwab API

### Limitations
- Complex, cluttered UI with too many tabs and options
- No specific focus on short-term trading timeframes (15-120 min)
- Lack of clear validation visualizations for recommendations
- Overwhelming amount of data presented simultaneously
- No sentiment analysis integration for recommendations

### UI Issues (Based on Screenshots)
- Information overload with too many tabs and controls
- Lack of visual hierarchy and focus
- Inconsistent styling and layout
