- Multi-timeframe analysis with confluence detection
- Technical indicators implementation including:
  - Basic indicators (RSI, Moving Averages)
  - Advanced indicators (CMO, Stochastic RSI, OBV, A/D Line)
  - Market regime indicators (AMA, volatility regime classification)
- Dynamic timeframe weighting based on market conditions
- Adaptive lookback periods based on volatility
- Risk management features including position sizing and exit points
- Feature engineering pipeline for ML components
- Fixed import error in historical_data_manager.py by changing absolute imports to relative imports
- Completely disabled synthetic data generation functionality
- Implemented theoretical options data generation based on underlying asset prices
- Added Black-Scholes model for calculating theoretical option prices and Greeks
- Refined implementation to prioritize theoretical approach using Schwab API data
- Added caching mechanism for theoretical data to improve performance
- Fixed VIX symbol data retrieval by implementing fallback to "^VIX" format
- Fixed None value multiplication error in ML integration risk management
- Implemented robust options symbol parser to extract underlying symbols
- Enhanced data collector to use underlying stock data instead of options data
- Implemented multi-timeframe data retrieval and analysis for better market insights
- Added fallback mechanisms for ML predictions when options data is missing
- Implemented comprehensive error handling and logging system
- Added caching for frequently accessed data to improve performance
- Fixed Bollinger Bands calculation error in recommendation_engine.py by properly handling DataFrame return values
- Fixed database connection error in options_db.py by properly initializing the connection variable and ensuring data directories exist
- Fixed 'price_history' attribute error in data_collector.py by implementing proper Schwab API client methods with mock authentication for testing
- Implemented all missing technical indicator calculation methods in the TechnicalIndicators class:
  - RSI (Relative Strength Index)
  - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
  - Stochastic Oscillator
  - ATR (Average True Range)
  - ADX (Average Directional Index)
  - OBV (On-Balance Volume)
  - CMF (Chaikin Money Flow)
  - MFI (Money Flow Index)
  - CCI (Commodity Channel Index)
  - Bollinger Bands
  - IMI (Intraday Momentum Index)
  - Fair Value Gap (FVG)
- Fixed pandas dtype incompatibility error in technical indicators calculations by ensuring proper type handling

## Current Work in Progress
- Testing the enhanced recommendation engine with the new underlying data approach
- Verifying multi-timeframe analysis integration with ML predictions
- Ensuring all implemented features are properly utilized
- Improving error handling and database operations
- Validating the Schwab API client methods implementation for historical data retrieval

## Known Issues or Challenges
- Historical data for option symbols is not available, now using underlying stock data instead
- ML predictions need to be generated from underlying data when options data is missing
- Need to verify the functionality of ML components with the new data approach
- Database operations need proper directory creation and connection handling
- Schwab API authentication requires interactive login, implemented mock authentication for testing

## Next Steps
- Complete testing of the integrated features
- Verify that all advanced indicators are being properly utilized
- Implement any remaining features from the algorithm recommendations
- Enhance documentation with usage examples for advanced features
- Consider adding more timeframes for analysis to improve prediction accuracy
- Implement additional error handling for database operations
- Implement proper authentication handling for Schwab API in production environment
