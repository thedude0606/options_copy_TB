# Progress Report

## Completed Features
- Basic dashboard setup with tabs for Recommendations, Technical Indicators, and Greeks Analysis
- Enhanced Recommendation Engine integration
- Multi-timeframe analysis with confluence detection
- Technical indicators implementation including:
  - Basic indicators (RSI, Moving Averages)
  - Advanced indicators (CMO, Stochastic RSI, OBV, A/D Line)
  - Market regime indicators (AMA, volatility regime classification)
- Dynamic timeframe weighting based on market conditions
- Adaptive lookback periods based on volatility
- Risk management features including position sizing and exit points
- Feature engineering pipeline for ML components
- Fixed import error in historical_data_manager.py by changing absolute imports to relative imports
- Completely disabled synthetic data generation functionality

## Current Work in Progress
- Integration of advanced indicators into the main application flow
- Testing the enhanced recommendation engine in the dashboard
- Ensuring all implemented features are properly utilized

## Known Issues or Challenges
- The recommendations tab was using the basic RecommendationEngine instead of the EnhancedRecommendationEngine
- Some advanced features may require additional integration to be fully utilized
- Need to verify the functionality of ML components in the main application flow

## Next Steps
- Complete testing of the integrated features
- Verify that all advanced indicators are being properly utilized
- Implement any remaining features from the algorithm recommendations
- Enhance documentation with usage examples for advanced features
