# Progress Report

## Completed Features/Tasks
- Initial repository setup
- Created documentation structure (PROGRESS.md, TODO.md, DECISIONS.md)
- Cloned Schwabdev repository and copied necessary files
- Implemented Schwab API authentication with OAuth flow handling
- Developed options data retrieval functionality
- Created dashboard interface with tabs for options chain, Greeks, and historical data
- Set up main application entry point
- Fixed import issues in app.py
- Updated requirements.txt for better compatibility across Python versions
- Fixed API method names to match Schwabdev library (client.get_option_chain → client.option_chains, client.get_price_history → client.price_history, client.get_quote → client.quote)
- Fixed parameter name in option_chains() method call (changed 'includeQuotes' to 'includeUnderlyingQuote')
- Fixed historical data retrieval by adding required 'periodType' parameter to price_history() method call
- Added extensive debugging code to historical data retrieval and visualization
- Enhanced historical data visualization with daily close price line chart alongside candlestick chart
- Implemented retry logic for historical data API with multiple parameter combinations
- Added sample data generation fallback when API fails to return historical data
- Implemented real-time data functionality using Schwabdev Streamer capabilities
- Created StreamingDataManager class to handle WebSocket connections
- Developed StreamDataHandler for processing and formatting streaming data
- Added a new Real-Time Data tab to the dashboard
- Implemented symbol selection controls for real-time data monitoring
- Added connection management functionality (start/stop streaming)
- Created real-time data visualization components (price chart, data table, time & sales)

## Current Work in Progress
- Enhancing error handling for streaming data
- Optimizing real-time data performance
- Exploring additional streaming data visualization options

## Known Issues or Challenges
- Schwab API authentication requires user interaction to complete OAuth flow
- Need to adapt data processing based on actual API response structure
- Installation issues with specific pandas version addressed by using more flexible version requirements
- API method names in the Schwabdev library differ from what was initially expected
- Streaming data requires proper field mapping to correctly display all available data
- WebSocket connection may need reconnection logic for long-running sessions

## Next Steps
- Test the application with real API credentials in a production environment
- Enhance error handling for streaming connection issues
- Add more detailed documentation about streaming data field mappings
- Implement additional visualization options for real-time data
- Consider adding alerts or notifications for price movements
- Explore options for saving streaming data for later analysis
