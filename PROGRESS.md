# Options Recommendation Platform - Progress

## Completed Features/Tasks

- **Repository Analysis**: Analyzed the existing GitHub repository structure and code
- **Schwab API Integration**: Reviewed Schwab API documentation and understood authentication flow
- **Development Environment**: Set up the development environment with required dependencies
- **Data Collection**: Implemented a comprehensive DataCollector class for retrieving market data
- **Technical Indicators**: Developed a module with the following indicators:
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
  - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
  - Bollinger Bands
  - Intraday Momentum Index (IMI)
  - Money Flow Index (MFI)
  - Fair Value Gap (FVG)
  - Liquidity Zones
  - Moving Averages (SMA, EMA)
- **Options Analysis**: Created an options analysis module with:
  - Greeks calculations (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho)
  - Probability of profit estimation
  - Risk-reward ratio calculation
- **Recommendation Engine**: Implemented a recommendation engine that:
  - Integrates technical indicators with options analysis
  - Generates trading signals based on multiple indicators
  - Scores options based on probability, risk-reward, and Greeks
  - Provides confidence scores and detailed rationales
- **User Interface**: Built a comprehensive UI with:
  - Trade Cards component for displaying recommendations
  - Recommendations tab with filtering capabilities
  - Technical Indicators tab with interactive charts
  - Greeks Analysis tab with 3D visualizations
  - Main application layout integrating all components
- **Bug Fixes**: Fixed critical issues in the codebase:
  - Resolved datetime handling error ("Can only use .dt accessor with datetimelike values")
  - Implemented consistent handling of 'daysToExpiration' column across multiple components
  - Added robust type checking for timedelta objects to prevent accessor errors
  - Fixed missing 'underlyingPrice' issue in options data retrieval
  - Implemented proper callback registrations for all dashboard tabs
  - Created missing Historical Data tab functionality
  - Fixed duplicate callback errors by adding prevent_initial_call=True parameter to callbacks with allow_duplicate=True in historical_tab.py and greeks_tab.py
  - Fixed "name 'frequency_value' is not defined" error in historical_tab.py by correcting variable name mismatch
  - Fixed "TechnicalIndicators() takes no arguments" error by implementing proper class initialization with data parameter
  - Added instance methods to TechnicalIndicators class to handle method calls from indicators_tab.py
  - Fixed "'TechnicalIndicators' object has no attribute 'macd'" error by implementing missing macd and money_flow_index methods
- **Recent Bug Fixes and Enhancements** (March 2025):
  - Added enhanced debugging capabilities with multiple debug levels (DEBUG_MODE, VERBOSE_DEBUG, LOG_API_RESPONSES)
  - Fixed timeframe mapping issues in indicators_tab.py to properly handle different time intervals (1m, 5m, 15m, etc.)
  - Implemented comprehensive parameter validation for historical data retrieval to ensure API compatibility
  - Added robust error handling throughout the option chain processing pipeline
  - Implemented multiple fallback mechanisms for retrieving underlying price data
  - Enhanced error handling for date/time conversions and calculations
  - Added detailed logging for API responses and data processing steps
  - Fixed issues with recommendation data not being populated correctly
  - Implemented dynamic timeframe selection based on period compatibility requirements
  - Added compatibility validation between period types and frequency types according to Schwab API requirements
  - Created a new callback function to ensure users can only select compatible timeframe/period combinations
  - Enhanced recommendation engine with comprehensive debugging and improved data flow tracing
  - Fixed option data processing to properly extract and use underlying price information
  - Improved the scoring algorithm to handle edge cases better in the recommendation engine
  - Fixed Bollinger Bands calculation by correcting parameter name mismatch ('num_std' to 'std_dev')
  - Enhanced recommendation engine to always show top recommendations even when confidence threshold isn't met
  - Fixed logic flow in recommendation engine to properly implement the fallback mechanism for displaying recommendations
  - Fixed UI display issue by updating trade card component to handle the current recommendation data format
  - Implemented symbol validation and correction for historical data to handle common ticker symbol mistakes
  - Added missing calculate_sma method to technical indicators module to fix indicators chart display

## Current Work in Progress

- Testing the implemented fixes for technical indicators and timeframe display issues
- Validating the recommendation data population with different symbols
- Enhancing error handling for edge cases in the Schwab API responses
- Improving the robustness of the option chain processing pipeline
- Implementing additional fallback mechanisms for data retrieval
- Optimizing performance for handling large options chains

## Known Issues/Challenges

- Need to ensure proper authentication with Schwab API in production environment
- Handling edge cases in datetime processing for options with unusual expiration formats
- Potential performance bottlenecks when processing large option chains
- Inconsistent data formats in Schwab API responses requiring additional validation
- Recommendation data may show incomplete information for certain symbols or market conditions

## Next Steps

- Complete testing of the implemented fixes for technical indicators and timeframes
- Implement additional error handling for edge cases in API responses
- Add more comprehensive logging throughout the application
- Create automated tests for critical components
- Optimize performance for real-time data processing
- Enhance the user interface to provide better feedback on data loading and processing status
- Document the debugging process and solutions for future reference
