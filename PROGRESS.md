# Progress Report

## Completed Features/Tasks
- Initial repository setup
- Created documentation structure (PROGRESS.md, TODO.md, DECISIONS.md)
- Cloned Schwabdev repository and copied necessary files
- Implemented Schwab API authentication with OAuth flow handling
- Developed options data retrieval functionality
- Created dashboard interface with tabs for options chain, Greeks, and historical data
- Set up main application entry point
- Fixed import issues in app.py
- Updated requirements.txt for better compatibility across Python versions
- Fixed API method names to match Schwabdev library (client.get_option_chain → client.option_chains, client.get_price_history → client.price_history, client.get_quote → client.quote)
- Fixed parameter name in option_chains() method call (changed 'includeQuotes' to 'includeUnderlyingQuote')
- Fixed historical data retrieval by adding required 'periodType' parameter to price_history() method call
- Added extensive debugging code to historical data retrieval and visualization
- Enhanced historical data visualization with daily close price line chart alongside candlestick chart
- Implemented retry logic for historical data API with multiple parameter combinations
- Added sample data generation fallback when API fails to return historical data

## Current Work in Progress
- Testing the updated API method implementations
- Final documentation updates

## Known Issues or Challenges
- Schwab API authentication requires user interaction to complete OAuth flow
- Need to adapt data processing based on actual API response structure
- Installation issues with specific pandas version addressed by using more flexible version requirements
- API method names in the Schwabdev library differ from what was initially expected

## Next Steps
- Test the application with the updated API method names
- Ensure the dashboard correctly displays options data including price, candles, and the Greeks
- Consider adding more detailed error handling for API interactions
- Add more comprehensive documentation about the Schwabdev API method naming conventions
