  - Fixed duplicate callback errors by adding prevent_initial_call=True parameter to callbacks with allow_duplicate=True in historical_tab.py and greeks_tab.py
  - Fixed "name 'frequency_value' is not defined" error in historical_tab.py by correcting variable name mismatch
  - Fixed "TechnicalIndicators() takes no arguments" error by implementing proper class initialization with data parameter
  - Added instance methods to TechnicalIndicators class to handle method calls from indicators_tab.py
  - Fixed "'TechnicalIndicators' object has no attribute 'macd'" error by implementing missing macd and money_flow_index methods
- **Recent Bug Fixes and Enhancements** (March 2025):
  - Added enhanced debugging capabilities with multiple debug levels (DEBUG_MODE, VERBOSE_DEBUG, LOG_API_RESPONSES)
  - Fixed timeframe mapping issues in indicators_tab.py to properly handle different time intervals (1m, 5m, 15m, etc.)
  - Implemented comprehensive parameter validation for historical data retrieval to ensure API compatibility
  - Added robust error handling throughout the option chain processing pipeline
  - Implemented multiple fallback mechanisms for retrieving underlying price data
  - Enhanced error handling for date/time conversions and calculations
  - Added detailed logging for API responses and data processing steps
  - Fixed issues with recommendation data not being populated correctly
  - Implemented dynamic timeframe selection based on period compatibility requirements
  - Added compatibility validation between period types and frequency types according to Schwab API requirements
  - Created a new callback function to ensure users can only select compatible timeframe/period combinations
  - Enhanced recommendation engine with comprehensive debugging and improved data flow tracing
  - Fixed option data processing to properly extract and use underlying price information
  - Improved the scoring algorithm to handle edge cases better in the recommendation engine
  - Fixed Bollinger Bands calculation by correcting parameter name mismatch ('num_std' to 'std_dev')
  - Enhanced recommendation engine to always show top recommendations even when confidence threshold isn't met
  - Fixed logic flow in recommendation engine to properly implement the fallback mechanism for displaying recommendations
  - Fixed UI display issue by updating trade card component to handle the current recommendation data format
  - Implemented symbol validation and correction for historical data to handle common ticker symbol mistakes
  - Added missing calculate_sma method to technical indicators module to fix indicators chart display
  - Added missing calculate_ema method to technical indicators module to fix indicators chart display
  - Enhanced historical data processing with robust error handling and type checking to ensure data is properly displayed
- **UI Redesign** (March 2025):
  - Created new v2 branch for UI redesign implementation
  - Simplified the UI with a single global symbol input shared across all tabs
  - Implemented a modern tile-based experience for displaying option recommendations
  - Redesigned the main dashboard layout with a cleaner, more intuitive structure
  - Added a dedicated header with global symbol search functionality
  - Created a left sidebar with trading timeframe, market overview, and watchlist sections
  - Redesigned the trade card component to match the new tile-based design
  - Added visual progress bars for confidence scores
  - Implemented color-coding for call and put options (green for calls, red for puts)
  - Added comprehensive CSS styling for the new UI components
  - Improved the visual hierarchy and information display in recommendation tiles
- **Advanced Trading Analysis** (March 2025):
  - Implemented comprehensive candlestick pattern recognition module with detection for:
    - Hammer and Hanging Man patterns
    - Doji candles
    - Bullish and Bearish Engulfing patterns
    - Shooting Star pattern
    - Morning Star and Evening Star patterns
    - Order Block detection for institutional supply/demand zones
  - Created a multi-timeframe analysis system that:
    - Analyzes patterns across multiple timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h)
    - Assigns weighted importance to different timeframes
    - Integrates candlestick patterns with technical indicators
    - Provides combined sentiment analysis across timeframes
    - Calculates confidence scores based on multi-timeframe confirmation

## Current Work in Progress

- Implementing options profit prediction model with time decay projections
- Developing enhanced confidence probability calculation system
- Integrating multi-timeframe data collection with Schwab API
- Testing the candlestick pattern recognition module with real market data
- Validating the multi-timeframe analyzer with different symbols and market conditions
- Enhancing error handling for edge cases in the Schwab API responses
- Improving the robustness of the option chain processing pipeline
- Implementing additional fallback mechanisms for data retrieval
- Optimizing performance for handling large options chains
- Ensuring responsive design for different screen sizes

## Known Issues/Challenges

- Need to ensure proper authentication with Schwab API in production environment
- Handling edge cases in datetime processing for options with unusual expiration formats
- Potential performance bottlenecks when processing large option chains
- Inconsistent data formats in Schwab API responses requiring additional validation
- Recommendation data may show incomplete information for certain symbols or market conditions
- Ensuring consistent styling across different browsers and devices
- Multi-timeframe data fetching may require optimization to reduce API calls
- Candlestick pattern detection parameters may need fine-tuning for different market conditions

## Next Steps
