# Options Recommendation Platform - Progress

## Completed Features/Tasks

- **Repository Analysis**: Analyzed the existing GitHub repository structure and code
- **Schwab API Integration**: Reviewed Schwab API documentation and understood authentication flow
- **Development Environment**: Set up the development environment with required dependencies
- **Data Collection**: Implemented a comprehensive DataCollector class for retrieving market data
- **Technical Indicators**: Developed a module with the following indicators:
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
  - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
  - Bollinger Bands
  - Intraday Momentum Index (IMI)
  - Money Flow Index (MFI)
  - Fair Value Gap (FVG)
  - Liquidity Zones
  - Moving Averages (SMA, EMA)
- **Options Analysis**: Created an options analysis module with:
  - Greeks calculations (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho)
  - Probability of profit estimation
  - Risk-reward ratio calculation
- **Recommendation Engine**: Implemented a recommendation engine that:
  - Integrates technical indicators with options analysis
  - Generates trading signals based on multiple indicators
  - Scores options based on probability, risk-reward, and Greeks
  - Provides confidence scores and detailed rationales
- **User Interface**: Built a comprehensive UI with:
  - Trade Cards component for displaying recommendations
  - Recommendations tab with filtering capabilities
  - Technical Indicators tab with interactive charts
  - Greeks Analysis tab with 3D visualizations
  - Main application layout integrating all components
- **Bug Fixes**: Fixed critical issues in the codebase:
  - Resolved datetime handling error ("Can only use .dt accessor with datetimelike values")
  - Implemented consistent handling of 'daysToExpiration' column across multiple components
  - Added robust type checking for timedelta objects to prevent accessor errors
  - Fixed missing 'underlyingPrice' issue in options data retrieval
  - Implemented proper callback registrations for all dashboard tabs
  - Created missing Historical Data tab functionality

## Current Work in Progress

- Integrating the existing real-time data streaming functionality with the new components
- Finalizing the UI components and ensuring they work together seamlessly
- Testing the platform with real data
- Enhancing error handling for edge cases

## Known Issues/Challenges

- Need to ensure proper authentication with Schwab API in production environment
- Optimization needed for handling large options chains efficiently
- Need to validate the accuracy of the probability calculations and Greeks estimations
- Ensuring the UI is responsive and user-friendly across different screen sizes
- Handling edge cases in datetime processing for options with unusual expiration formats

## Next Steps

- Complete integration of all UI components
- Implement comprehensive testing of all features
- Add documentation for users
- Optimize performance for real-time data processing
- Deploy the platform for production use
